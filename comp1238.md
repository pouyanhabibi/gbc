## Week 1 - History
- One writing system can be used by many languages
- Cuneiform looks weird
- The Epic of Gilgamesh was epic
## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes
- ASCII table taps numbers to characters
- Volatile memory loses data when power is off
- Non-Volatile memory retains data without power
- Byte is a group of 8 bits
## Week 3 - Text Structure 
- Markdown is a simple syntax for formatting.(Titles: # Title, ## Subtitle, Italic: _italic_, Bold: **bold**, Lists: * item or - item)
- Special Characters like non-alphanumeric symbols (@, #, $, &, *) ned escape sequences prevent special interpretation. Example: \# to display # in Markdown.
## Week 4 - Keyboards and Editors
- Word Processors like Word, are designed for rich text formatting. Convenient for documents intended for human reading/printing. Very inconvenient for writing code.
- Text Editors like VS Code are designed for plain text. Each byte typically corresponds directly to a character via ASCII. Provide precise control over the raw text file. Essential for writing code.
## Week 5 - CLI
- CLI is an interface where you type commands and the computer responds with text.
- CLI is faster, have precise control, good for remote work and low resurce usage, and it looks cool.
